v0.13:
 * Preliminary conda support

v0.12:

 * Add stringent pipeline

v0.11 (25th July 2017):
 * Revert back to Ryan Wick's porechop repo as --untrimmed now implemented
 * New script: align_trim_fasta.py and reconstitute.py as basis for more
   principled demultiplexing (align first, then trim to known amplicon end
   points +/- 40 bases) to help prevent chimeric reads resulting in 
   incorrect barcode identification
